👋 Hi, I’m Bastien


👀 I’m interested in cybersecurity, IA, game, web developpment.
I love to travel and have visited Belgium, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Netherlands, Indonesia(Bali)


🌱 I can work in Paris or full remote.
I worked with Php Laravel, and VueJS. Aswell I maintaied website on NodeJS during my work (info-retraite.com and subdomains).
I like to work with Php, C#, Python or Javascript because I prefer the back end although I don't mind working on the front end.
I'm curious to learn the front end and differents animations so I check Codrops website to learn good ones.
I like to solve diffrents problems or learn differents languages on FreeCodeCamp, HackerRank or Codingame.
In add I practice on RootMe because I want to discover and learn about the cybersecurity.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project, web or not. I try to learn every free time and I'm curious to work with anyone
