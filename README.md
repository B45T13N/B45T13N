👋 Hi, I’m Bastien


👀 I’m interested in cybersecurity, IA, game, web developpment.
I love to travel and have visited Belgium, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Netherlands, Indonesia(Bali)


🌱 I’m currently learning web developpment with l'ENI Ecole Informatique, and I'm working in Paris.
I like to work with Php and Javascript because I prefer the back end although I don't mind working on the front end.
I'm curious to learn the front end and differents animations so I check Codrops website to learn good ones.
I like to solve diffrents problems or learn differents languages on FreeCodeCamp, HackerRank or Codingame
In add I practice on RootMe because I want to discover and learn about the cybersecurity.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project, web or not. I try to learn every free time and I'm curious to work with anyone
