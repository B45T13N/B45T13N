ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in cybersecurity, IA, game, web developpment.
I love to travel and have visited Belgium, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Netherlands, Indonesia(Bali), Egypt

ðŸŒ± I work in Paris or from home.

I worked with C#, Php Laravel, and VueJS. Aswell I maintained website on NodeJS during my work (info-retraite.com and subdomains).
I like to work with Python or Javascript because I prefer the back end although I don't mind working on the front end.
I'm curious to learn the front end and differents animations so I check Codrops website to learn good ones.
I like to solve diffrents problems or learn differents languages on FreeCodeCamp, HackerRank or Codingame.
In add I practice on RootMe, TryHackMe, HackTheBox to discover and learn about the cybersecurity.
